📊 Project Overview:
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that analyzes and visualizes road accident data to provide actionable insights. The dashboard aims to help stakeholders identify trends, understand accident causes, and explore factors influencing road safety.T With this dashboard, users can filter and view data based on various dimensions such as date, location, type of road, weather conditions, and casualty severity. It’s a powerful tool for traffic authorities, safety analysts, and decision-makers to make data-driven decisions to reduce road accidents and enhance road safety measures.

🗂️ Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this project includes the following key columns:
Accident Date: The date of each accident.
Vehicle Type: The type of vehicle involved (e.g., car, motorcycle, bus).
Casualty Severity: Classification of casualties as serious, slight, or fatal.
Road Type: The type of road where the accident occurred (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway).
Weather Conditions: Environmental conditions during the accident (e.g., rain, fog, clear).
Lighting Conditions: Time of day or lighting conditions during the accident (e.g., daylight, darkness).
Urban/Rural: Whether the accident occurred in an urban or rural area.
District: Geographic location of the accident.

🔑 Key Features:
KPI Cards: Displays metrics such as total accidents, casualties, and severity rates.
Visualizations:
Line Chart: Trends in accidents over time.
Pie Charts: Distribution of accidents by road type, lighting, and urban/rural areas.
Map: Heatmap of accidents by district.
Filters: Dynamic slicers for road surface, weather conditions, and vehicle types.
Interactive Insights: Highlights significant patterns, such as accident severity by conditions.

💡 Insights:
Identified peak accident periods and seasonal patterns.
Highlighted road types and lighting conditions with higher accident frequencies.
Mapped accident hotspots by district for targeted interventions.
Compared current year (CY) data with previous trends to measure improvements or declines.
